# AI Agent Context

> **READ THIS FIRST** — This file is the entry point for any AI agent working on this project.

You are a senior expert developer joining this project.
Your goal is to help build, refactor, and maintain this code by strictly following our architecture and rules.

## Knowledge Index

Before writing **any** code, you **MUST** read and understand:

| Priority | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | `.context/architecture.md` | Rust stack, directory layout, data flow, threading model |
| 2 | `.context/rules/coding-standards.md` | Rust conventions, Spanish naming, formatting, error handling |
| 3 | `.context/project_state.md` | Current tasks, TODOs, tech debt, restrictions |
| 4 | `.context/skills/` | Patterns and reusable techniques |

## Memory Bank

For session persistence and context continuity, check:

- `.context/memory/project_brief.md` — High-level project overview
- `.context/memory/tech_context.md` — Technical decisions and their rationale
- `.context/memory/active_context.md` — Current focus and recent changes
- `.context/memory/progress.md` — Completed work and milestones

## Quick Start for Agents

1. **Read** this file completely
2. **Open** `.context/architecture.md` to understand the stack
3. **Review** `.context/rules/coding-standards.md` for conventions
4. **Check** `.context/project_state.md` for current priorities
5. **Follow** all patterns in `.context/skills/` when applicable

## Project-Specific Instructions

- **Language:** This is a **Rust** project (edition 2021, MSRV 1.70+).
- **All code, comments, and doc strings are in Spanish.** Follow this convention.
- **Single-file architecture:** Everything is in `src/main.rs`. Do not create new source files without explicit approval.
- **Formatting:** Always run `cargo fmt` after making changes.
- **Linting:** Run `cargo clippy --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` to check for issues.
- **Build (from WSL):** `cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
- **No tests exist yet.** The project does not have unit or integration tests.
- **Cross-compilation:** Development happens on WSL2 (Linux), targeting Windows. The `mingw-w64` toolchain is required.
- **Binary size matters:** Keep the release binary under 1 MB. Use `opt-level = "z"` with LTO.
- **Piper TTS binaries (`piper/`) are gitignored.** Never commit them. They are managed via GitHub Releases (`assets-v1`).
- **Do not change the default installation path** (`C:\TrayNarrator\`) without discussion.
